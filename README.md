I try to outsmart myself with this new attempt at learning C++/SFML/gamedev/linux as devving platform.
Somewhat trying to not read too many tutorials beforehand as an exercise in critical thinking (not because I'm lazy and impatient; nope, nope).

=====
Stuff used during development of this project:

SFML 2.1 (because Yay, frameworks)

Clang 3.2 (because Yay, compilers!)

Qt Creator 2.7.0 (because Reddit likes it)

Linux Mint 15 (because Ubuntu is too mainstream, and I'm a baby. Also outdated.)

Git Cola GUI (because I'm lazy and frightened)

Trello (because progress!)
